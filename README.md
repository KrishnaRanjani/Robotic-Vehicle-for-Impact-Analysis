## Overview
#### *  IoT is all about connecting electronic devices together and exchanging data 
  
#### * Robotic vehicle is controlled by an individual via android application
      
#### * Data obtained by the system is monitored by an android application

#### * Environmental visualization is obtained through smart camera system
 
#### * Two way Audio communication and visualization is obtained

#### * The proposed system is cost-effective when compared to other existing methods.

#### * The system can update the data to the application for every seconds

#### * Latitude and longitude coordinates are obtained.

## ⌽ PROTOTYPE

### Sensors 
    Sensors used to obtain data about the environmental condition through IoT platform are
  * `Temperature Sensor` : LM35
  * `Gas Sensor`         : MQ-2
  * `Photoresistor`      : LDR
  * `Humidity Sensor`    : DHT11
  * `Pressure sensor`    : DIGITAL AIR PRESSURE

## ⌽ NAVIGATION  

### Navigation and Control Module
  * L293D Motor driver IC is used to control the autonomous movement
  * It allows DC motor to drive on either direction
  * Dual H-bridge Motor Driver integrated circuit (IC)
  * Two major sections in navigation and control
    * Controlling the robotic vehicle
    * Monitoring the system

## ⌽ COMMUNICATION  ARCHITECTURE

  * NODE MCU is use as a IoT gateway.
  * It serves as a connection point between cloud and controllers, Arduino.
  * Sensor data ,Visualization and Two way audio communication details obtained from  robotic vehicle is transmitted to the app through IoT gateway.
  * GPS Location is  obtained from IoT module

## RESULTS
 * The prototype can work effectively in remote places to collect data alone or in teams
 * Secured data in IoT platform can be accessed from anywhere of the world
 * System updates sensor data to IoT server in every seconds
 * Sampling of events can be done that are too dangerous for Human
 * Communications can be established
